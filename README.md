  <p>
    A responsive barber and grooming service website, <br />

  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in 2023. <br />
    During that time, I focused on learning and didn't upload my projects to GitHub. <br />
    I am now working on React.js and Next.js projects.
